# NewSpringLearning
This is my progress repo of learning spring boot.
I will add new branches to everyday that i work.Incase of any doubts or clarifications switch to the appropriate branch.
I already have basic idea of core java but obviously will be learning more as I progress here.

Let the journey begin 

I started on 20-March-2025 with the basics of spring like IoC ,DI ,profile ,Qualifier etc.

On 21-March-2025 I learnt basic spring rest API and created a small backend application for storing course details
